						<p>This guide will cover the basics of working with the Git <acronym title="Version Controll System">VCS</acronym> and present a workflow for using Git and GitHub to manage development of Silverstripe based projects.</p>

						<h1>Git Primer</h1>
					</div>
					<p>The biggest mental hurdle for many users who have experience using centralised version control systems (such as Subversion) when first starting with Git is understanding the distributed nature of Git. Moving from a centralised version control system to a distributed system (like Git) makes it possible to use a wide range of workflows. There is an excellent discussion of <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git-Distributed-Workflows">some possible workflows</a> in the Git book. This document won’t look at the possible workflows in any great detail, but it is worth understanding the possibilities, as it helps make clear the differences between centralised (like Subversion) and distributed (like Git) version control systems.</p>
					<p>The most important point to understand about Git is that there is no distinction between a repository and a working copy, such as you would find in a centralised VCS like Subversion. Every Git working copy is also a complete, self-contained repository with a complete history including all branches and tags. </p>

						<h1>Working with Branches <small>creating, merging, tagging, etc.</small></h1>
					</div>
					<p>Git branches work in much the same way as in other VCSs, with one distinct difference - one of Git’s greatest strengths is merging your branch changes (or changes from a remote repository) back into the main branch of your repository (called ‘master’ in Git).</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span4">
						<h3>Create</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<p>Creating a branch is as simple as calling the <code>git-branch</code> function and specifying a name.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
$git branch &lt;branch-name&gt;
						</pre>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span4">
						<h3>Checkout</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<p>Git won’t automatically check it out at the same time. To checkout a branch (the equivalent of svn switch).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
$git checkout &lt;branch-name&gt;
						</pre>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span4"></div>
					<div class="span4">
						<p>If you’re creating a branch which you want to checkout and work with immediately, you can also use the checkout command to create a branch.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
$git checkout -b &lt;branch-name&gt;
						</pre>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span4"><h3>List</h3></div>
					<div class="span4">
						<p>You can also quickly get a list of all existing branches by omitting the branch name.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
$git branch
development
experiment
* master
						</pre>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span4"><h3>Delete</h3></div>
					<div class="span4">
						<p>To delete a branch, you first need to make sure your branch is fully merged back into either the branch you’re currently on (often referred to as HEAD) or the upstream branch (i.e. the branch from which it was originally merged).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
$git branch -d &lt;development&gt;
						</pre>
					</div>
				</div>
				
			</section>
			<section id="merge" class="row-fluid">
				<div class="span12">
					<div class="page-header"><h2>Merging</h2></div>
					<p>After you’ve made some changes on your branch (or after you’ve pulled changes from a remote repository), you’ll probably want to merge those changes back into your <code>master</code> branch.</p>
					
				</div>
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span8">
						<p>Before performing a merge, it’s important to make sure there are no uncommitted changes (you can check by running <code>git status</code>. If you’re not quite ready to commit your changes, but you want to merge in some other code, you can also use the git-stash command to temporarily tidy things up.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="span4">
						<pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
$git merge &lt;branch-name&gt;
						</pre>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row-fluid">
					<div class="span12">
						<p>Even though Git makes merging simple, you will inevitably encounter conflicts which cannot be automatically resolved from time to time. If you attempt a merge which results in a conflict, Git will notify you which files are conflicted, and at this point you have two options.</p>
						<p>1. Decide not to merge. It’s easy to revert the merge simply by running the <code>git merge --abort</code></p>
						<p>2. Resolve the conflicts and <code>git add &lt;conflicted-file-name&gt;</code> then <code>git commit</code> to finalise it.</p>
						<p>Note: An alternative to the <code>merge</code> command is the <code>rebase</code> command, which is sometimes more appropriate, but beyond the scope of this document.</p>
